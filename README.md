# Find_Sentence_Similarity

### There are several similarity metrics that can be used to compare the similarity between two sentences.
#### Here are some of the most commonly used similarity metrics:

#### Cosine similarity:
- measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity score is calculated as the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. The range of values for cosine similarity is between -1 and 1, where a score of 1 indicates that the two sentences are identical, a score of 0 indicates that the two sentences are completely dissimilar, and a score of -1 indicates that the two sentences are opposite to each other.

#### Euclidean distance:
- measures the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance score is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors. The range of values for Euclidean distance is between 0 and infinity, where a distance of 0 indicates that the two sentences are identical, and a larger distance indicates that the two sentences are more dissimilar.

#### Manhattan distance:
- measures the distance between two points in a grid-like path. The Manhattan distance score is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors. The range of values for Manhattan distance is between 0 and infinity, where a distance of 0 indicates that the two sentences are identical, and a larger distance indicates that the two sentences are more dissimilar.

#### Jaccard similarity:
- measures the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets. In the context of text similarity, Jaccard similarity can be used to compare the similarity between two documents based on the words they contain.

The choice of similarity metric depends on the specific use case and the type of data being compared. In general, cosine similarity is a popular choice for text similarity tasks because it is fast and effective.
